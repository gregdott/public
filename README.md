# My Public Code

This repository is to serve as the storehouse for all my public code.

## ðŸ”´Important!ðŸ”´
You will probably see multiple instances of `Pr.x("some string")`. This is just a shorthand class I created to save myself having to write out `System.out.println("some string")` every time I want to print to the console. Just leaving this note about that here to save ***you*** the time it might take to figure out what `Pr.x()` is.

## What's in here?

There will be various bits and pieces of code added to this repo.

For starters, I am implementing the `Top 25 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know` mentioned at https://www.techiedelight.com/top-25-algorithms-every-programmer-should-know/ This is in the `Algos` folder.

All the code here will be my own personal implementations (unless otherwise stated in the readme for the folder or the file in question)

More interesting stuff will follow...
