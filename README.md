# My Public Code

This repository is to serve as the storehouse for all my public code.

## ðŸ“¢Important!ðŸ“¢
You will probably see multiple instances of `Pr.x("some string")`. This is just a shorthand class I created to save myself having to write out `System.out.println("some string")` every time I want to print to the console. Just leaving this note about that here to save ***you*** the time it might take to figure out what `Pr.x()` is.

So, in case you try to run something from the `Algorithms` folder for example, and don't have the Utils folder downloaded as well, you will run into issues. In this case, just replace all occurrences of the string `Pr.x` with `System.out.println` and remove the `import Utils.Pr;` line and things should run fine.

## What's in here?

There will be various bits and pieces of code added to this repo.

For starters, I am implementing the `Top 25 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know` mentioned at https://www.techiedelight.com/top-25-algorithms-every-programmer-should-know/ 

This is in the `Algorithms` folder.

All the code here will be my own personal implementations (unless otherwise stated in the readme for the folder or the file in question)

More interesting stuff will follow...
