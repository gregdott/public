# My Public Code

This repository is to serve as the storehouse for all my public code.

## What's in here?

There will be various bits and pieces of code added to this repo.
For starters, I am implementing the `Top 25 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know` mentioned at https://www.techiedelight.com/top-25-algorithms-every-programmer-should-know/
All code is my own personal implementation of these algorithms.

More interesting stuff will follow...
