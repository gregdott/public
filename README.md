# My Public Code

This repository is to serve as the storehouse for all my public code.

## What's in here?

- Algorithms (contains my own implementations of well known algorithms)
- BibleLoops (A rather odd project I am working on. I enjoy working with graphs and visualising data as graphs. The kind with vertices and edges. There are 31 102 Bible verses and a ton of cross references. This makes for some interesting graphs to be explored).

## ðŸ“¢Important!ðŸ“¢
You will probably see multiple instances of `Pr.x("some string")`. This is just a shorthand class I created to save myself having to write out `System.out.println("some string")` every time I want to print to the console. Just leaving this note about that here to save ***you*** the time it might take to figure out what `Pr.x()` is.

So, in case you try to run something from the `Algorithms` folder for example, and don't have the Utils folder downloaded as well, you will run into issues. In this case, just replace all occurrences of the string `Pr.x` with `System.out.println` and remove the `import Utils.Pr;` line and things should run fine.
